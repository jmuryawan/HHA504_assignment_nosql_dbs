## 3 - Documentation of your experience and reflections on working with each platform (BigQuery, MongoDB Atlas, Redis Cloud)

### **BigQuery**
super easy, simple, and straightforward to do

### **MongoDB Atlas**
everything was simple when starting to create the cluster and then making a connection through the app. got a bit more confused on how to add collection and then convert it to json but eventually was able to figure it out!

### **Redis Cloud**

Describe the setup process and any configuration steps.
Share your reflections on the interface and usability of each platform.
