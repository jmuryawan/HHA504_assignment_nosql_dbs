## 3 - Documentation of your experience and reflections on working with each platform (BigQuery, MongoDB Atlas, Redis Cloud)

### **BigQuery**
The setup process and configuration were fairly straightforward to accomplish. The interface is consistent with the ease of use throughout the platform and its various features. The SQL workspace is intuitive for querying, and built-in templates make it simple to get started. Out of the 3 databases, BigQuery was the easiest to use. It might have helped that I am more familiar with GCP as well. 

### **MongoDB Atlas**
Starting with creating a cluster and then making a connection through the app was feasible. I got a bit more confused on how to add a collection and then convert it to JSON, but I eventually figured it out with the help of the GUI. But overall, MongoDB's interface is modern and visually appealing. The initial setup and schema design were a bit challenging since I am not familiar with NoSQL concepts at this time.

### **Redis Cloud**
The setup and configuration worked out smoothly with Redis as well. I had a much harder time figuring out how to import the dataset but then realized I had to create a key. Querying the information was a bit hard too. For a beginner, the absence of a graphical management tool made it difficult to navigate. However, the CLI is easily visible and accessible.
